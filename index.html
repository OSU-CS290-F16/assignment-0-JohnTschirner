<h2> The most interesting fact about me: </h2>
	<p> Before moving to Corvallis I lived in Steamboat Springs, Colorado. Steamboat is a small ski town where I used to be able to ski 60-80 days a year. I guess the most interesting thing about me is where I'm from and the opprotunity I was given growing up in a ski town. </p>
